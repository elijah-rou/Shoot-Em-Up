Hey There Tutor!

First Thing's first, the game is not exactly finished. You can certainly  
play it, but there's a few things to mention. 

1)  Please run the game in 1024x768, I did not get a chance to optimise it
    for other resolutions, and so the UI only fits perfectly in the aforementioned
    resolution.
2)  The AI component of the game functions, there is however a bug that affects the creeps
    firing lasers in a certain direction. I tried but simply could not fix it. 
    Please, try to ignore it haha
3)  The Controls are in listed in the game itself under the "Controls" menu
4)  The goal of the game is to kill your opponent (or not to die)
5)  There is a large amount of content I did not manage to complete in the Assets,
    please ignore it.
6)  The boost ability accelerates the player forward. It functions on a 3 second cooldown after use
7)  I have included final builds in Builds/
